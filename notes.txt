Lab3: Nate is b0$$, nice lab, it works. 
You need to have your problems and warning windows open at all time! 13 warnings! gahhh!!!!
For example
You have: 
const unsigned char DIVIDER[25] = "-------------------------";
and
drawString(10,10,DIVIDER);

Look at the type of what your suppose to be passing into a function. drawString accepts a pointer for char, you attempted to pass in unsigned char. Cast or follow the type def of the function you are using. 
drawString(10,10,(char *)DIVIDER); is proper and will yield no errors or warnings. Don't rely on the compiler to save you.
